# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Lint Arwaky v1.10.2

---

## 1. Product Overview

**Name**: Lint Arwaky
**Type**: CLI tool + MCP server
**Version**: 1.10.2
**License**: MIT
**Language**: Rust (2021 edition)

Lint Arwaky is an autonomous multi-language linting, type-checking, and architectural rule auditing tool. It runs as both a CLI binary (`lint-arwaky-cli`) and an MCP server (`lint-arwaky-mcp`) that exposes 5 tools over JSON-RPC 2.0.

The project audits itself: `lint-arwaky-cli check .` runs the same AES rule engine against `src-rust/` that it runs against third-party code.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Software projects accumulate quality debt silently. Developers lack:

- A single tool that audits Rust + Python + JavaScript/TypeScript together
- Architectural enforcement that prevents cross-layer violations in multi-domain codebases
- A unified interface for both human developers (CLI) and AI agents (MCP tools)
- A self-auditing tool whose own codebase passes the rules it enforces
- Static analysis with zero bypass tolerance (`noqa`, `type: ignore`, `#[allow(...)]` are flagged)

---

## 3. AI Agent Value

Lint Arwaky is designed to integrate with AI coding agents through its MCP interface, providing:

| Value Driver               | Description                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent Autonomy**   | Agents operate without human oversight via 5 MCP tools                                   |
| **Multi-Agent Sync** | Jobs are tracked in a thread-safe registry accessible across agent instances             |
| **Self-Healing**     | The `fix` command applies safe auto-fixes; the `suggest` command guides manual fixes |
| **24/7 Quality**     | The `watch` command polls and re-lints continuously during development                 |

---

## 4. Target Users

| User                             | Interface          | Use Case                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AI Agents**              | MCP tools (5)      | Automated code review, pre-commit checks, CI integration |
| **Prototype Developers**   | MCP + CLI          | Fast iterations, AI-assisted coding, quality gates       |
| **Architecture Engineers** | Architecture tools | AES rule enforcement, clean code, DDD                    |
| **Developers**             | CLI (20+ commands) | Local development, watch mode, git hooks                 |
| **CI/CD Pipelines**        | CLI + exit codes   | Quality gates, SARIF/JUnit/JSON reports                  |
| **Contributors**           | GitHub + PRs       | New adapters, CLI commands, MCP tools                    |

## 7. Architecture

### 7.1 Domain Model (6 Layers)

```
src-rust/
  agent/           -- Lifecycle, orchestration, pipeline, DI container
  capabilities/    -- Use-case logic: analysis, formatting, architecture
  contract/        -- Interfaces: traits, protocols, aggregates
  infrastructure/  -- Adapters: rust_linter, python_ruff, eslint, transports
  surfaces/        -- Interfaces: CLI (clap), MCP (mcp-sdk-rs)
  taxonomy/        -- Domain types: value objects, models, errors, constants
```

### 7.2 Dependency Rules

```
agent          -> taxonomy, contract, infrastructure, capabilities
surfaces       -> taxonomy, contract
capabilities   -> taxonomy, contract
infrastructure -> taxonomy, contract
contract       -> taxonomy
taxonomy       -> taxonomy
```

Surfaces may NOT import from `agent`, `capabilities`, or `infrastructure` directly — they interact with `agent` only through the `ServiceContainerAggregate` trait (AES023, AES022).

### 7.3 MCP Server Architecture

The MCP server uses `mcp-sdk-rs` 0.3.4 over JSON-RPC 2.0 on stdin/stdout. It announces `protocolVersion: 2024-11-05` and exposes the `tools` capability.

```
mcp_main_entry.rs    -- tokio main loop, reads JSON-RPC from stdin
mcp_tools_command.rs -- execute_command / list_commands / commands_schema /
                       read_skill_context / health_check
mcp_server_handler.rs / mcp_server_wrapper.rs -- Schema, validation, lifespan
mcp_command_handler.rs -- command_catalog and dispatch
```

The DI container is created once at server start; the same `Arc<dyn ServiceContainerAggregate>` is passed to every tool call.

### 7.4 Agentic Engineering System (AES) v1.10.2

Severity levels and their point penalty per finding:

| Severity | Penalty | Description                                   |
| -------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| LOW      | -1      | Minor style or naming issue                   |
| MEDIUM   | -2      | Structural concern, barrel/import patterns    |
| HIGH     | -3      | Architecture violation, mandatory requirement |
| CRITICAL | -5      | Bypass markers, dead inheritance, layer fraud |

Total score starts at 100.0 and is deducted per finding. If any CRITICAL finding exists, the run fails regardless of score.

**AES006 Primitive Policy**: Value Object enforcement is **granular per layer**:

- `contract` and `taxonomy(entity|error|event)` → `no_primitives: true` (strict)
- `infrastructure`, `capabilities`, `surfaces` → `no_primitives: false` (adapter layers may use primitives as supporting types)
- `taxonomy(constant)` → raw primitives allowed by definition; must contain ONLY constant declarations (AES033)

**AES033 Constant Purity (v1.10.2)**: Taxonomy files ending in `_constant` must contain only `pub const` / `pub static` declarations. Any `struct`, `enum`, `fn`, or `impl` block in a `_constant` file is a violation.

See [docs/AES_RULES.md](docs/AES_RULES.md) for the full rule catalog (31 codes: AES001–AES033, AES028/029 reserved) and [docs/AESArchitecture.md](docs/AESArchitecture.md) for the layered specification with Mermaid diagrams.

## 8. MCP Interface (5 Tools)

| Tool                              | Purpose                                        |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `execute_command(action, args)` | Execute any CLI command                        |
| `list_commands(domain)`         | Discover available CLI commands                |
| `commands_schema(tool_name)`    | Retrieve the JSON Schema for a registered tool |
| `read_skill_context(section)`   | Read SKILL.md documentation by section         |
| `health_check()`                | Check linter adapter health and system state   |

> **Note**: Job cancellation is exposed as the CLI subcommand `lint-arwaky-cli cancel <job_id>` rather than an MCP tool.

---

## 9. CLI Interface

Subcommands are defined in `src-rust/surfaces/cli_core_command.rs` and dispatched from `cli_main_entry.rs`.

| Category | Subcommands                                                                |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Core     | check, scan, fix, report, ci, version, adapters, security, cancel          |
| Scans    | complexity, duplicates, trends, dependencies                               |
| Setup    | setup init, setup doctor, setup mcp-config, setup hermes                   |
| Dev      | diff, suggest, import, export, config, install-hook, uninstall-hook, watch |
| Git      | git-diff, multi-project                                                    |

---

## 10. Constraints

- Pure-Rust implementation (no embedded Python or Node.js runtime)
- No database required (file-based history only for trends)
- Static binary release via `cargo build --release`
- Platform: Linux, macOS, Windows (MSVC and GNU)

---
