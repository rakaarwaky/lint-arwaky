# Changelog

## 1.10.14 (Upcoming)

### Removed

- **Deleted dead crates**: Removed `pipeline-jobs`, `output-report`, `plugin-system`, `lifecycle-state` — unused or replaced by other crates.
- **Removed `pub use` re-exports** from `crates/lib.rs` for deleted crates.
- **Removed unused CLI commands**: `suggest`, `multi-project`, `cancel`, `import`, `export`, `diff`, `report`, `complexity` — stubs or redundant with existing commands.
- **Removed `setup doctor`**: Moved to `maintenance doctor` (top-level subcommand).

### Added

- **`maintenance doctor`**: Environment diagnostics moved from `setup doctor` to `maintenance doctor` — better placement for periodic health checks.
- **`watch` with inotify**: Proper file watcher using `notify` crate (inotify on Linux) with debounce, instead of polling-based sleep loop.
- **AES304 (BypassComment) enforcement — self-lint fix**: The `BypassChecker` in `crates/code-analysis/src/capabilities_check_bypass_checker.rs` now reliably flags `.unwrap_or_default`, `.unwrap_or`, `.unwrap_or_else`, `.expect(...)`, `panic!(...)`, `todo!(...)`, `unimplemented!(...)`, and `unreachable!(...)` as AES304 CRITICAL violations. Previously the pattern matcher only fired on the literal `.unwrap()` (with empty parens), so the majority of `.unwrap_*` and `.expect_*` call-sites in production code were silently passing. The checker now (a) reads forbidden patterns from `ArchitectureConfig.rules[AES304].code_analysis.forbidden_bypass` via a new `BypassChecker::from_patterns(...)` constructor, (b) walks the Rust method-call chain across `_segment` boundaries so every `.unwrap_or*` and `.expect_*` variant is detected, and (c) requires a leading `.` for method tokens (preventing false positives on identifier names like `unwrap_helper`). 17 unit tests in `capabilities_check_bypass_checker` cover positive matches, false-positive guards, config-driven patterns, and test-module / `Lazy<Regex>` skip rules. Config YAML keys renamed from `patterns:` to `forbidden_bypass:` across `lint_arwaky.config.{rust,python,javascript}.yaml` so YAML actually reaches the checker (previously ignored due to serde flatten on `CodeAnalysisRuleVO.forbidden_bypass`).
- **File-path extension bug fix — self-lint root cause**: `FilePath::extension()` no longer rejects paths whose string representation starts with `.` (e.g. `./foo.rs`). The previous implementation returned `""` for any path beginning with `.`, which caused `LanguageDetector::is_lintable` to skip relative paths emitted by `std::fs::read_dir` in `collect_source_files`. Net effect: `lint-arwaky check .` was scanning zero source files when invoked with a relative project root, which silently hid every other AES rule. The fix extracts the basename first, then runs the special-file and dot-prefix checks against it. 4 regression tests in `taxonomy_path_vo.rs` cover `./foo.rs`, `/home/user/.gitignore`, full paths, and `Makefile`/`Dockerfile`.
- **`[workspace.lints.clippy]` in `Cargo.toml`**: Centralized clippy policy at the workspace level. Currently enables `result_large_err = "warn"` for visibility; documents the deliberate exclusion of `clippy::unwrap_used` / `clippy::expect_used` (the AES304 self-lint policy is the project's source of truth for those patterns, not clippy) and `clippy::module_name_repetitions` (the AES layer-trait naming convention embeds layer names on purpose).
- **AES304 per-language panic-equivalent detection**: `BypassChecker` now detects language-native panic idioms that mirror Rust's `panic!()` / `unimplemented!()`. Python files fire on `raise NotImplementedError` (or `raise NotImplemented`) → AES304 UNIMPLEMENTED and on `assert False, "..."` → AES304 PANIC. JavaScript/TypeScript files fire on `throw new Error(...)`, `throw new TypeError(...)`, `throw new RangeError(...)`, `throw new ReferenceError(...)`, and `throw new SyntaxError(...)` → AES304 PANIC. Detection is language-scoped via `LanguageDetector::detect` on the file extension, so cross-language false positives (e.g. Python code mentioning `throw new error` as an identifier name) cannot fire. 14 new unit tests cover positive cases for Python and JS/TS plus negative guards for `expect(value).toBe(5)` (Jest), `throw err` (re-throw), `raise ValueError("...")` (legitimate error), and Python `throw new error` as identifier.
- **Ignore vendor minified assets in `lint_arwaky.config.rust.yaml`**: Added `.min.js` and `.min.css` to `ignored_paths` so third-party libraries (e.g. `packages/vscode-extension/media/cytoscape.min.js`) are not scanned by AES304. Without this, every minified `.js` shipped under `packages/` would generate dozens of false positives from `throw` statements inside the library's own source.

### Changed

- **Renamed `language-adapters` → `external-lint`**: Crate directory and Cargo.toml name updated.
- **Replaced hardcoded extension checks**: 13 locations across 10 files now use `ILanguageDetectorPort` instead of `ends_with()` — language detection is now a single source of truth via `source-parsing`.
- **Inlined `ReportFormatterProcessor::format_text()` logic** into `root_cli_main_entry.rs` — removed import from the separate crate.
- **AES renumbering (final v3.0)**: All 24 codes reorganized into 5 groups (Naming AES100s, Import AES200s, Quality AES300s, Role AES400s, Orphan AES500s). Old AES codes removed from `RULES_AES.md` and docs updated.

### Documentation

- **Updated all docs**: `AGENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DEPLOY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `PRD.md`, `RULES_AES.md`, `SKILL.md` — aligned crate lists, AES codes, supported commands, and removed references to deleted crates.
- **`SKILL.md`**: Trimmed to only document CLI commands that are actually implemented and supported.
- **`PRD.md`**: FR table matched to actual AES rules; removed feature requirements for deleted crates.
- **`RULES_AES.md`**: Filled all empty descriptions based on actual code enforcement; removed AES103/AES104.

## 1.10.9 (2026-06-11) — Published to crates.io + Linux-Only Installer

### Added

- **Published to crates.io**: `lint_arwaky v1.10.9` now available via `cargo install lint_arwaky`.
- **crates.io badge**: Added to `README.md`.

### Changed

- **`install.remote.sh` rewritten (Linux-only)**: Replaced Python-based `auto-linter` install flow with Rust/Cargo. Script now exits immediately on non-Linux OS. Primary install via `cargo install lint_arwaky`; fallback to pre-built GitHub Release binaries (Linux x86_64 only).
- **`mcp.local.json`**: Updated to use `cargo run --manifest-path ... --release --bin lint-arwaky-mcp` for local development.
- **`release.yml` fixed**: Smoke-test command corrected from `check . --format json` (invalid flag) to `report . --output-format json`. Updated `actions/attest-build-provenance` from `@v1` to `@v2`.
- **All docs updated to v1.10.9**: `README.md`, `DEPLOY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `PRD.md`, `TEST.md`. Broken `docs/` folder links replaced with root-level `RULES_AES.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

---

## 1.11.0 (2026-06-09) — AES Renumbering + Barrel Removal

### Changed

- **AES renumbering (v2.0)**: All 27 active codes reorganized into 4 groups (Layer & Import AES001–AES006, Naming & Structure AES010–AES016, File & Content AES020–AES024, Role Violations AES030–AES038). Old-to-new mapping documented in `RULES_AES.md`.
- **Vertical slicing restructuring**: Replaced 6 layer directories (`taxonomy/`, `contract/`, `capabilities/`, `infrastructure/`, `agent/`, `surfaces/`) with 26 feature/domain folders under `src-rust/`.
- **File naming convention**: Changed from `[domain]_[concept]_[suffix].rs` to `[layer]_[concept]_[suffix].rs`. Layer is now a file prefix, not a directory.
- **All 258 source files moved and renamed** — zero architectural changes, zero new features. Pure structural refactoring.
- **Build verified**: 0 errors, 0 warnings.

### Removed

- **Barrel re-export rules (AES007/AES012/AES013)**: Removed. Layer violations are detected by filename prefix, not barrel structure.
- **MCP Schema rule (AES025)**: Removed as unnecessary.
- **All `pub use` from non-barrel files**: Cleaned up. Direct imports used instead.

## 1.10.2 (2026-06-07) — 31 AES Rules Complete

### Added

- **Full 31/31 AES coverage**: All 31 AES codes (AES001–AES033, AES028/029 reserved) implemented and verified. 30/31 unique codes detected across Rust self-lint, Python, and JS test projects.
- **AES030 capability-method-not-found**: Dispatch integrity check — verifies capability methods exist in dispatch catalog.
- **AES031 single-capability-bottleneck**: Detects when all dispatch routes go to a single capability class.
- **AES032 missing-vo-construction**: Flags capability calls missing required Value Object parameters.
- **AES033 constant-purity**: Ensures `_constant` files contain only `pub const`/`pub static` declarations.
- **Multi-language configs**: `lint_arwaky.config.rust.yaml`, `lint_arwaky.config.python.yaml`, `lint_arwaky.config.javascript.yaml` — per-language architecture enforcement with language-specific bypass patterns and barrel conventions.
- **Docs**: `RULES_AES.md` — full AES rule catalog with multi-condition import matrices, suffix tables, and agent role mandates. `ARCHITECTURE.md` — complete AES architecture reference with Mermaid diagram.

### Changed

- **Architecture docs**: Suffix tables expanded to match full config lists across all languages.
- **Self-lint verified**: 153 violations detected on own codebase (15 AES codes), 0 CRITICAL.

## 1.10.1 (2026-06-06) — Rust Reference Implementation

### Changed

- **Full language migration**: Lint Arwaky is now implemented in Rust (edition 2021). The Python v1.9.x codebase is preserved for reference; the active project lives in `src-rust/` and produces two binaries: `lint-arwaky-cli` and `lint-arwaky-mcp`.
- **MCP stack**: Replaced the Python `mcp.server.fastmcp.FastMCP` framework with `mcp-sdk-rs` 0.3.4 speaking JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdin/stdout. Protocol version announced: `2024-11-05`.
- **CLI stack**: Replaced Click with `clap` 4.6.1 derive macros. Subcommand groups are still defined in `src-rust/surfaces/cli_core_command.rs`.
- **Naming convention**: 3-word snake_case filenames with a layer-role suffix (e.g., `architecture_compliance_analyzer.rs`, `lint_score_constant.rs`). The same AES003 rule applies to both `.py` and `.rs` files.

### Added

- **AES033 `constant-purity` rule**: New taxonomy rule. Files ending in `_constant` may contain only `pub const` / `pub static` declarations. `struct`, `enum`, `fn`, `impl`, `mod`, `pub mod`, `pub use` blocks in a `_constant` file trigger AES033 (HIGH). See [RULES_AES.md](RULES_AES.md).
- **5 MCP tools wired through Rust**: `execute_command`, `list_commands`, `commands_schema`, `read_skill_context`, `health_check` — all routed through `src-rust/surfaces/mcp_tools_command.rs`.
- **20+ CLI subcommands**: `check`, `scan`, `fix`, `ci`, `git-diff`, `security`, `duplicates`, `dependencies`, `maintenance doctor`, `setup init|install|mcp-config|hermes`, `adapters`, `config show`, `watch`, `install-hook`, `uninstall-hook`, `version`, `vscode-graph`, `orphan`.
- **Report formats**: `text`, `json`, SARIF 2.1.0 (with `$schema` and `version: 2.1.0`), JUnit XML — all delegated to `ReportFormatterProcessor` (capability layer).
- **AST scanners**: New infrastructure adapters for Rust (`ast_rust_scanner`), Python (`ast_py_scanner`), and JavaScript/TypeScript (`ast_js_scanner`) source parsing.
- **Self-lint target**: `lint-arwaky-cli check .` scans `src-rust/` under the same AES rule engine that is exposed to third-party projects.

### Fixed

- **DI wiring**: `DependencyInjectionContainer::new()` lazy-creates every adapter and exposes them through `Arc<dyn ServiceContainerAggregate>` so surface code can call into Agent via the trait only (AES023).
- **Severity model**: `Severity::score_impact()` now centralizes penalty math; CRITICAL findings fail the run regardless of total score.

## 1.9.4 (2026-05-20) — Pragmatic Primitive Policy Refactoring

### Added

- Flexible Primitive Types Allowance: Disabled `no_primitives` check (`no_primitives: false`) for `infrastructure`, `capabilities`, and `surfaces` layers to eliminate unnecessary boxing overhead and simplify third-party integrations (e.g., FastMCP, Click).

### Changed

- Strict Value Object Policy: Kept `no_primitives: true` active strictly for core `contract` and `taxonomy` domain layers to guarantee zero technical leakage.
- Restored original clean files for `mcp_server_lifespan.py`, `mcp_server_validator.py`, `mcp_server_schemas.py`, and `mcp_server_resources.py` and discarded temporary utility bypasses.

## 1.9.0 (2026-05-09) — Score 100/100 & Zero Lint

### Fixed

- All 46 B101 asserts: Replaced with proper `if/raise RuntimeError` guard pattern.
- 11 B404/B603 subprocess: Added `# nosec` on trusted command paths verified via `shutil.which`.
- 10 B110/B112 try/except: Added `logger.debug/warning` before `pass/continue`.
- 1 B108 tempfile: `# nosec` on legitimate temp path reference.
- 8 radon complexity hotspots: Extract method pattern refactoring in 5 files.
- Ruff E402: Import ordering in `maintenance_commands_orchestrator`.
- Ruff F401/F821: Unused imports and undefined variables across 4 files.
- Mypy relative imports: Replaced `taxonomy.X` with direct imports.
- CLI crash: Added missing `http_provider` DI parameter.
- Architecture violations: `sys.modules` hack removed, 5 singletons → lazy factories, 17 `asyncio.run()` → `run_async()` bridge.

### Added

- `contract.async_bridge_aggregate.run_async()` utility for safe event loop handling.
- Proper logging in all bare exception handlers.

### Changed

- Score range restored: negative scores now pass through (core feature).
- UV tool reinstall now required after source changes (`uv tool install --reinstall .`).

### Added

- CLI `import` command: Import config from JSON/YAML file.
- Report delegate: SARIF and JUnit output now delegate to `ReportFormatterProcessor` (capability layer) instead of inline implementation.
- Config import method: `DevCommandsSurface.import_config()`.

### Fixed

- MCP tool name: `get_system_health` → `health_check` to match SKILL.md spec.
- CLI command name: `multi_project` → `multi-project` (hyphen, not underscore).
- SARIF output: Was emitting `model_dump()` JSON instead of SARIF format — now correctly delegates to `ReportFormatterProcessor.to_sarif()`.

### Changed

- Version sync: All documents synced to 1.8.0.

## 1.7.0 (2026-05-06) — Architecture Hardening

### Fixed

- All adapters (ruff, mypy, bandit, radon): `PatternList(value=cmd)` → `PatternList(values=cmd)`. Pydantic field name mismatch caused empty command lists. All external linter adapters now produce violations correctly.
- Path normalization: Phantom root replacement now only applies when path doesn't exist. Prevents double-path concatenation on already-valid absolute paths.
- Radon adapter: Fixed `'str' object has no attribute 'value'` error in scan path handling.

### Added

- Architectural Enforcement: Implemented strict hardening rules via `lint-arwaky.config.python.yaml`.
- Naming Conventions: Enforced 3-word underscore-separated filenames (`word1_word2_word3.py`).
- Class Mandate: Mandatory class definitions for all logic files (except `__init__.py`).
- Layer Hardening: Introduced mandatory contract inheritance and explicit layer-to-contract mappings.
- Suffix Enforcement: Strict suffix checks for all layers (e.g., `_vo`, `_port`, `_orchestrator`).
- Integrity Rules: Forbidden primitives in core layers; must use Value Objects (VOs).
- Agent Specialization: Formalized roles for Container, Manager, Orchestrator, Registry, and Coordinator.

### Changed

- Thresholds: Increased default quality score threshold to 100.0.
- File Limits: Reduced maximum allowed line count per file from 500 to 300.
- Rules: Unified architectural rules into `global`, `internal`, and `external` categories.

## 1.6.9 (2026-04-30)

### Changed

- Architecture: Transitioned from 5-domain to 6-domain architecture by introducing the `contract` layer.
- Configuration: Replaced `layer_map` and `governance_rules` with `layers` and `rules` in `lint-arwaky.config.yaml`.
- Naming: Renamed "Governance" adapter to "Architecture" adapter.

## 1.6.3 (2026-04-30)

### Fixed

- PyPI Publishing: Reverted to token-based publishing to ensure compatibility with existing repository secrets.

## 1.6.2 (2026-04-30)

### Fixed

- Package Metadata: Fixed a critical issue where `pyproject.toml` was truncated, causing PyPI upload failures.

## 1.6.1 (2026-04-30)

### Improved

- Version Alignment: Synced versioning across all metadata files (pyproject.toml, SKILL.md, PRD.md).

## 1.6.0 (2026-04-30) — CI/CD Modernization

### CI/CD & Automation

- PHANTOM_ROOT test fix — conftest.py force-override environment variables for consistent test results
- VS Code mypy settings — `.vscode/settings.json` for proper src/ layout resolution

### Critical Fixes

- Architecture leaks eliminated — 0 cross-layer violations (surfaces↛infra, capabilities↛infra, infra↛agent, capabilities↛agent)
