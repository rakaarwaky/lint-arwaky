## File: ARCHITECTURE.md

```rust
# Agentic Engineering System Architecture

## 1. Purpose

The Agentic Engineering System is a layered, AI-native architecture pattern. It keeps domain models stable, business logic readable, technical detail isolated, and layer boundaries explicit enough for both humans and AI agents to modify the system safely.

---

## 2. Workspace Organization

The architecture supports multi-language workspaces.

| Term               | Meaning                                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project Workspaces | Project root containing all configuration and language members    |
| Workspace Member   | One self-contained crate, package, or module inside the workspace |
| Crates directory   | Rust workspace members                                            |
| Packages directory | TypeScript or JavaScript packages                                 |
| Modules directory  | Python modules or sub-projects                                    |

---

## 3. Naming Convention

File names must communicate three parts:

1. Layer as prefix
2. Concern as middle name
3. Role as suffix

The parts are joined by underscores, followed by the normal file extension for the language.

`layer_concern_role.rs/py/ts`

---

## 4. Vertical Slicing Folder Structure

The recommended folder structure follows this order:

#### Features member

_Example feature crate `crates|packages|modules/<name-features>/`_

``` `text
surface_<concern>_<role>.rs/py/ts                ← surface layer
capabilities_<concern>_<role>.rs/py/ts           ← capabilities layer
agent_<concern>_orchestrator.rs/py/ts            ← agent layer
``` `

Exceptions: `main.rs`, `lib.rs`, `mod.rs`, `__init__.py`, `index.ts`, `index.js`.

#### Shared member

`crates|packages|modules/shared/<common>or<domain-folder>`

``` `text
contract_<concern>_protocol.rs/py/ts             ← contract layer
contract_<concern>_aggregate.rs/py/ts            ← contract layer
taxonomy_<concern>_vo.rs/py/ts                   ← taxonomy layer
taxonomy_<concern>_event.rs/py/ts                ← taxonomy layer
taxonomy_<concern>_entity.rs/py/ts               ← taxonomy layer
taxonomy_<concern>_constant.rs/py/ts             ← taxonomy layer
utility_<concern>_<role>.rs/py/ts                ← utility layer
``` `

`shared` folder groups by domain. Use `shared/common/` for generic files.

---

## 5. Taxonomy Layer

### Purpose

Taxonomy is the domain foundation layer. It defines the stable language of the domain and must remain free from technical or behavioral concerns.

### Components

| Role         | Meaning                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Value object | Immutable data concept                |
| Entity       | Stateful domain concept with identity |
| Event        | Immutable domain fact                 |
| Error        | Domain-level error                    |
| Constant     | Compile-time literal value            |

### Dependencies

Taxonomy depends on nothing.

### Special Rules

- Value objects and Constants may use all primitive types.
- Entities, Events, and Errors must use Value objects/Constants instead of primitive types (bool/str is an exception).
- Constants must be compile-time values.
- Taxonomy must not contain business rules, infrastructure, or imports from other layers.

---

## 6. Contract Layer

### Purpose

Contract defines the public behavior of the system without exposing implementation. It allows callers to depend on stable interfaces instead of concrete logic.

### Components

| Role      | Meaning                                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Protocol  | Interface defining inbound behavior. It is implemented by Capabilities and consumed by the Agent. |
| Aggregate | Facade definition implemented by Agent, used by Surface to access feature behavior.               |

### Dependencies

Contract may depend on Taxonomy only.

### Special Rules

- Protocol defines behavior only without implementation.
- Aggregate hides Capabilities from Surface.

---

## 7. Utility Layer

### Purpose

Utility contains low-level technical mechanics. It exists so that Capabilities can remain clean and expressive.

### Role Naming

Utility role suffixes are unlimited. The role name is chosen based on demand and must describe the technical responsibility and concern of the file.

parser
splitter
trimmer
slugifier
sanitizer
normalizer
extractor
replacer
converter
counter
resolver
detector
builder
joiner
serializer
deserializer
encoder
decoder
hasher
generator
formatter
comparator
differ
matcher
checker
calculator
mapper
merger
grouper
sorter
deduplicator
printer

### Dependencies

Utility may depend only on Taxonomy.

### Technical Concern Examples

| Concern                 | Responsibility                                      |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| File discovery          | Walk directories, detect files, apply ignore        |
| External tool execution | Run linters, compilers, formatters, analyzers       |
| Parsing and matching    | Parse text, match patterns, extract structured data |
| Path normalization      | Normalize paths across platforms                    |
| System operations       | Handle process or environment mechanics             |

### Special Rules

- Utility must use stateless standalone functions only.
- Utility must not contain stateful objects, behavior definitions, or contract implementations.
- Utility must not make business decisions.
- Utility may perform technical operations if needed.
- Utility must not implement any contract.
- Utility role names may expand freely, but the layer must remain technical and standalone.
- Utility must use stateless standalone functions only.

---

## 8. Capabilities Layer

### Purpose

Capabilities contain the concrete implementation of the system's behavior. This layer encapsulates both **pure business logic** (computations, validations) and **external adaptations** (database access, third-party API calls, infrastructure mechanics). By hiding these implementations behind Contracts, the system keeps its behavior modular, swappable, and fully isolated from orchestration.

### Role Naming

#### Internal Examples

validator
assessor
calculator
resolver
classifier
selector
mapper
transformer
policy
enricher
evaluator
analyzer
scorer
grader
ranker
filter
checker
reviewer
approver
rejector

#### External Examples

repository
gateway
client
provider
fetcher
reader
writer
scanner
executor
publisher
subscriber
adapter
connector
uploader
downloader
sender
receiver
dispatcher
watcher
monitor

### Dependencies

- Capabilities may depend on Taxonomy, Contract, and Utility.
- Capabilities must not depend on or import other Capabilities.

### Concern Examples

Capabilities generally handle two types of concerns:

| Category                | Concern        | Responsibility                                 |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Business Logic**      | Validation     | Check domain conditions or input correctness   |
|                         | Computation    | Calculate scores, totals, or derived values    |
|                         | Transformation | Map, filter, reduce, or reshape data           |
|                         | Resolution     | Apply rules and decide outcomes                |
|                         | Assessment     | Judge severity, compliance, grade, or quality  |
| **External Adaptation** | Repository     | Fetch or persist domain entities to a database |
|                         | Integration    | Communicate with third-party services or APIs  |
|                         | Provider       | Generate data from external systems            |

### Special Rules

- **No Inter-Capability Dependency:** Capabilities must never import or call other Capabilities directly. They are standalone execution units.
- **Pipeline Aggregation:** Multiple Capabilities (e.g., Capability A for data fetching, Capability B for business calculation) are designed to be composed into a sequential pipeline by the **Agent Layer**, not by themselves.
- **Shared Logic Extraction (DRY):** If multiple Capabilities require the same technical mechanics or functions, that logic must be extracted into a reusable standalone function in the **Utility Layer**. Capabilities must not duplicate technical code (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- **Contract Implementation:** Capabilities must implement the `protocol_` defined in the Contract Layer.
- **State Ownership:** Capabilities are the owners of business and technical state within their execution scope.
- **Utility Delegation:** Capabilities must call Utility standalone functions when low-level technical operations are required, passing their state/data as arguments.
- **No Orchestration:** Capabilities must not contain flow control (looping across capabilities, branching between capabilities, or error escalation policy). They execute their single responsibility and return a result.
- **No Domain Definition:** Capabilities must not define domain models (Entities, Value Objects); they only consume and produce Taxonomy.

---

## 9. Agent Layer

### Purpose

Agent coordinates multiple capabilities into executable flows. It controls sequence and movement, not business calculation.

### Allowed Role

The only Agent role is orchestrator.

### Dependencies

Agent may depend only on Taxonomy, Contract, and Utility.

### Allowed Flow Control

| Flow Type               | Purpose                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Sequential execution    | Run steps in order                     |
| Looping                 | Process multiple items or events       |
| Branching               | Choose path based on result            |
| Error handling          | Recover, abort, continue, or escalate  |
| Timeout or cancellation | Stop long-running or asynchronous work |

### Special Rules

- Agent must depend on Contract, not concrete implementations.
- Agent must not use and must be completely ignorant of Capabilities implementations.
- Agent must not calculate business results.
- Agent must not define domain models.

---

## 10. Surface Layer

### Purpose

Surface is the outer boundary of the system. It handles user-facing or external-facing interaction and translates it into architectural actions.

### Allowed Roles

Surface roles include:

- command
- controller
- page
- view
- component
- router
- layout
- hook
- store
- action
- screen

### Surface Groups

| Group            | Roles                             | Dependencies                          | Rule                                            |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Smart surfaces   | command, controller, page, router | Taxonomy, Contract Aggregate, Utility | May initiate feature behavior through aggregate |
| Utility surfaces | hook, store, action, screen       | Taxonomy only                         | Support smart surfaces but must not import them |
| Passive surfaces | component, view, layout           | Taxonomy only                         | Presentation-only, no logic or orchestration    |

### Special Rules

- Smart surfaces must consume Contract Aggregates.
- Surfaces must not import Capabilities, Utility, or Agent directly.
- Surfaces must not contain business calculation or orchestration.

---

## 11. Root Layer

### Purpose

Root is the composition layer. It assembles the system by connecting concrete implementations to contracts and starting the application.

### Components

| Role      | Meaning                                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Container | Wires one feature by connecting Capabilities to Contract protocols and aggregates |
| Entry     | Bootstraps the application and composes feature containers                        |

### Dependencies

Root may depend on all layers.

### Special Rules

- Root may instantiate and wire components.
- Root must not contain business logic.
- Root must not contain orchestration policy.
- Root must not contain technical parsing or user interface behavior.

## File: crates/file-watch/FRD.md

```rust
# FRD — file-watch

## Feature Goal

The file-watch crate provides a filesystem monitoring system that detects file changes in real time and automatically re-triggers the linting pipeline. It uses notify and notify-debouncer-mini to optimize performance and avoid redundant processing during rapid changes.

## Requirements & Scope

- Recursive filesystem watching of project paths for create/modify/delete events.
- Debounced event aggregation so rapid changes do not trigger multiple lint runs.
- Automatic re-trigger of the linting pipeline on detected changes.
- Configurable watch roots and ignore patterns.
- Low resource usage during long-running watches.

## Success Indicators

- [ ] Responsiveness — file changes detected within 100ms–2s depending on debouncing.
- [ ] Debouncing effectiveness — rapid changes do not trigger multiple lint runs.
- [ ] Resource efficiency — memory usage remains low during long-running watches.
- [ ] Rule conformance — the crate itself passes AES rule checks when complete.
```

## File: crates/file-watch/src/agent_watch_orchestrator.rs

```rust
// PURPOSE: WatchOrchestrator — coordinates watch → analyze → lint pipeline
//
// The watch mode provides real-time feedback: when a file changes on disk,
// the watcher triggers a lint scan on that specific file and prints results.
//
// Architecture:
//   1. Performs an initial full lint on startup (gives baseline)
//   2. Starts the filesystem watcher (inotify on Linux, via `notify` crate)
//   3. Event loop: receives file-change events, checks if the file is
//      lintable (.rs, .py, .js, .ts, etc.), runs lint, prints results
//   4. Graceful shutdown: Ctrl+C triggers AtomicBool flag, stops watcher
//
// The event loop uses tokio::select! for cancellability — the sleep branch
// allows checking the running flag every 100ms without blocking on recv().
